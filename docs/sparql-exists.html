        <h3>Issue 1: Some uses of EXISTS are not defined during evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          The evaluation process in the specificiation is defined for graph patterns but
          there are situations where the evaluation is of an alegbra form not
          listed.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">FILTER EXISTS { SELECT ?y { ?y :q :c . } }</pre>
        and
        <pre class="nohighlight box">FILTER EXISTS { VALUES ?y { 123 } }</pre>
        <p>
          The argument to 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_evalExists"><code>exists</code></a>
          is not explicitly listed as a "Graph Pattern" in the table of SPARQL algebra symbols in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlQuery">section 18.2</a>
          when the argument to <code>EXISTS</code> is a 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rGroupGraphPattern">GroupGraphPattern</a>
          containing just a 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#subqueries">subquery</a>
          or just 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#inline-data">InlineData</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Issue 2: Substitution happens where definitions are only for variables</h3>

        <p>There are places in the SPARQL syntax and algebra where
          variables are allowed but not RDF terms (constant values).<p>

        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">FILTER EXISTS { BIND ( :e AS ?z ) { SELECT ?x { :b :p :c } } } }</pre>

        <p>Both positions "AS ?z" and "SELECT ?x" must be variables.</p>

        <p>In the algebra, this affects</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_extend"><code>extend</code></a>
            (related to the use of <code>AS</code> in SPARQL syntax)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#inline-data">in line data</a> 
          (related to the use of <code>VALUES</code>)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-bound"><code>BOUND</code></a></li>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Issue 3: Blank nodes substituted into BGPs act as variables</h3>

        <p>In the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#BasicGraphPattern"
             >evaluation of basic graph patterns</a> 
          (BGPs) blank nodes 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#BGPsparql">are replaced</a>
          by RDF terms from the graph being matched and variables are replaced by a solution
          mapping from query variables to RDF terms so that the  basic graph pattern is
          now a subgraph of the graph being matched.
        </p>
        <p>Simply substituting a variable with a blank node in the <code>EXISTS</code>
          evaluation process does not cause the basic graph pattern to be 
          to be restricted to subgraphs containing that blank node as an RDF term
          because it is mapped by an 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-mt-20040210/#definst">RDF instance
          mapping</a> before checking that the BGP after mapping is a subgraph of the
          graph being queried.
        </p>
        <p>Note that elsewhere in the evaluation of the SPARQL algebra, a solution
          mapping with a binding from variable to blank node, does treat blank nodes
          as RDF terms. They are not mapped by an RDF instance mapping.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">SELECT ?x WHERE {
    ?x :p :d .
    FILTER EXISTS { ?x :q :b . } }</pre>
        <p>
          against the graph <tt>{ _:c :p :d , :e :q :b }</tt>
          the substitution for <code>EXISTS</code> produces
          <tt>BGP(_:c :q :b)</tt> which then
          matches against <tt>:e :q :b</tt> because the <tt>_:c</tt> can be mapped to <tt>:e</tt> by
          the RDF instance mapping that is part of pattern instance mappings in 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#BGPsparql">18.3.1</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Issue 4: Substitution can flip MINUS to its disjoint-domain case</h3>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">
In
  SELECT ?x WHERE {
    ?x :p :c .
    FILTER EXISTS { ?x :p :c . MINUS { ?x :p :c . } } }
on the graph { :d :p :c }
the substitution from 18.6 ends up producing
  Minus( BGP( :d :p :c ), BGP( :d :p :c ) )
which produces a non-empty result because the two solution mappings for the
Minus have disjoint domains and 18.5 dictates that then the result is not
empty.
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Issue 5: Substitution affects disconnected variables</h3>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">
In
  SELECT ?x WHERE {
    BIND ( :d AS ?x )
    FILTER EXISTS { BIND ( :e AS ?z )
                    SELECT ?y WHERE { ?x :p :c } } }
the substitution from 18.6 ends up producing
  Join ( Extend( BGP(), ?z :e ),
         ToMultiSet( Project( ToList( BGP( :d :p :c ) ), { ?y } ) ) )

Some, but not all, implementations diverge from the spec here.

    <section> <h2>Proposal B</h2>
 
    <section>
      <h3>A Deep-Binding Alternative to Substitution</h3>
      <p>
        All filtering in SPARQL is determining whether a solution mapping passes some
        condition. We call this solution mapping the <dfn>current row</dfn> in this
        description. We call the 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlQuery">translation to the
          SPARQL algebra</a> of "pattern", the <dfn>EXISTS pattern</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evaluation of the <code>EXISTS</code> function is defined by the process of
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_substitute">substitution</a>
        appiled to the EXISTS pattern, which is then evaluated. The EXISTS filter
        expression is true if the evaluation results in one or more solution mappings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a section proposes an alternative mechanism.  Rather than replace each
        variable by the value it is bound to in the current row, this alternative
        mechanism makes the whole of the current row available at any point in the
        evaluation of an <code>EXISTS</code> expression. It uses the current row to
        restrict the binding of variables at the points where variable bindings are
        created during evaluation of <code>EXISTS</code> to be those from the current row.
        It makes illegal syntactic constructs that could lead to an attempt to rebind a
        variable from the current row through using the <code>AS</code> syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#solutions">Section 2.2</a> describes how this alternative definition of
        <code>EXISTS</code> addresses each of the issues identified in 
        <a href="#identified-issues">Identifed Issues section</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 3 parts to the proposal:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Renaming inner scope variables so that variables that are only used within a
          sub-query are not affected by the current row. This reflects the fact that in
          SPARQL such variables are not present in solutions mappings outside their
          sub-query.
        </li>
        <li>Disallowing syntactic forms that set variables potentially already present in the current
          row. SPARQL solutions mappings can only have one binding for a variable and the
          current row provides that binding.
        </li>
        <li>Restricting the value (the RDF term) that a variable can be mapped in a
          solution mapping during evaluation of <code>EXISTS</code>.  This is the
          replacement for substitution; evaluation that binds a variable proceeds through
          graph pattern matching but the values it can take are immediately restricted to
          that in the current row.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section>
        <h4>Renaming</h4>
        <p>
          Within sub-queries, variables with the same name can be used but do not
          appear in the overall results of the query if they do not occur in the
          projection in the sub-query. Such inner variables are not 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#variableScope">in-scope</a>
          when they are not mentioned in the projection part of the inner SELECT expression.
        </p>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">SELECT * {
    ?s :value ?v .
    FILTER EXISTS {
       {SELECT (count(*) AS ?C) {
            ?s :property ?w .
       }}
       FILTER ( ?C < ?v )
   }
}</pre>
        <p>Here, the <tt>?s</tt> is not mentioned in the projection in 
          <tt>SELECT (count(*) AS ?C)</tt>. Replacing <tt>?s</tt> by, for example,
          <tt>?V1234</tt> in the sub-query does not change the overall results.
        </p>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">SELECT * {
    ?s :value ?v .
    FILTER EXISTS {
       {SELECT (count(*) AS ?C) {
            ?V1234 :property ?w .
       }}
       FILTER ( ?C < ?v )
   }
}</pre>
        <p>Such variable usages can be replaced with a variable of a different name, if
          that name is not used anywhere else in the query, and the same results are
          obtained in the sub-query. A sub-query always has a projection as its top-most
          algebra operator.
        </p>
        <p>
          To preserve this, any such variables are renamed so they do not coincide with
          variables from the current row being filter by <code>EXISTS</code>.
        </p>
        <p>The SPARQL algebra "project" operator has two components, an algebra expression
          and a set of variables for the projection.
        </p>
        <div class="defn">
          <b>Definition: <a id="defn_projmap" name="defn_projmap">Projection Expression Variable Remapping</a></b>
          <p>
            For a projection algebra operation P with set of variables PV, define
            a partial mapping F from
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlQueryVariables">V</a>,
            the set of all variables, to V where:
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            F(v) = v if v in PV<br/>
            F(v) = v1 where v is a variable mentioned in the project expression, but not in PV, and v1 is a fresh variable<br/>
            F(v) = v otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Define the <dfn>Projection Expression Variable Remapping</dfn> PrjMap(P,PV) to
            be the algebra expression P (and the subtree over which the projection is
            defined) with F applied to every variable of the algebra expression P over
            which P is evaluated.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p> 
          This process is applied throughout the graph pattern of <code>EXISTS</code>:
        </p>
        <div class="defn">
          <b>Definition: <a id="defn_varrename" name="defn_varrename">Variable Remapping</a></b>
          <p>
            For any algebra expression X define the
            <dfn>Variable Remapping</dfn> PrjMap(X):
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            PrjMap(X) = replace all project operations <tt>project(P PV)</tt> with <tt>project(PrjMap(P,PV) PV)</tt> for each projection in X.
          </p>
          <p>This replacement is applied bottom-up when there are multiple project
            operations in the graph pattern of <code>EXISTS</code>.
        </div>
        <p>
          Applying the renaming steps inside a sub-query does not change the solution
          mappings resulting from evaluating the sub-query. Remapping is only applied to
          variables not visible outside the sub-query. Renaming a variable in a SPARQL
          algebra expression causes the variable name used in bindings from evaluating the
          algebra expression to change. Since these are only variables that are not
          visible outside the sub-query, because they do not occur in the projection, the
          result of the sub-query is unchanged. SPARQL algebra expressions can not access
          the name of a variable nor introduce a variable except by remapping. Remapping
          is only applied to variables not visible outside the sub-query.
        </p>

        <h4>Limitations on Assignment</h4>
        <p>
          SPARQL syntactic forms that attempt to bind a variable through the use of
          <code>AS</code> that might already be in a solution mapping are forbidden in
          SPARQL: this is covered in the syntactic restrictions of
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlGrammar">19.8 Grammar</a>, 
          notes 12 and 13.
        </p>
        <p>
          This proposal adds the restriction that any variables in a current
          row, the set of variables 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#variableScope">in-scope</a>
          of the FILTER containing EXISTS, can not be assigned with the <tt>extend</tt>
          algebra function linked to the <code>AS</code> syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, any use of <code>VALUES</code> in the EXISTS expression must not
          use a variable in the current row.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Restriction of Bindings</h4>
        
        <p>The proposal is to retain the variables from the current row, not
          substitute them for RDF terms, before evaluation, and also to restrict 
          the binding of the solution to the RDF term of the current row. This occurs
          after renaming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Binding for variables occur in several places in SPARQL:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#BGPsparql">Basic Graph Pattern Matching</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#PropertyPathPatterns">Property Path Patterns</a></li>
          <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_evalGraph">evaluation of algebra form
              <code>Graph(var,P)</code></a> involving a variable (from the syntax <code>GRAPH ?variable {...}</code>)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that other places where solution mappings add variables are in
          <code>extend</code> function (connected to the <code>AS</code> syntax)
          and <code>a multiset</code> from <code>VALUES</code> syntax.
          <a href="#limitations-on-assignment">Limitations on Assignment</a> 
          forbid this being of variables of the current row.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restricting the RDF Terms for a variable binding is done using
          inline data that is joined with the evalaution of the basic graph pattern,
          property path or graph match.

      <h3>Solutions</h3>

      <p>This section addresses each issue identified, given the proposal above.</p>
      
      <section>
        <h4>Issue 1: Some uses of EXISTS are not defined during evaluation</h4>
        
        <p>This can be handled by handling solution sequences as graph patterns where
          needed by adding 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_algToMultiSet">toMultiSet</a>
          as is done fot <a href="#rSubSelect">SubSelect</a>
          in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlTranslateGraphPatterns">18.2.2.6 Translate Graph Patterns</a>
          with a a correction to the text at the end of
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlQuery">Section 18.2</a>
          introductory paragraph.
        </p>

<pre class="nohighlight box">query-errata-N:

"Section 18.2 Translation to the SPARQL Algebra" intro (end):

ToMultiSet can be used where a graph pattern is mentioned below because the
outcome of evaluating a graph pattern is a multiset.

Multisets of solution mappings are elements of the SPARQL algebra.  Multisets
of solution mappings count as graph patterns.

        <h4>Issue 2: Substitution happens where definitions are only for variables</h4>
        <p>
          Rather then replace a varialbe by its value in the current row, the new
          mechanism makes the binding of variable to value available. The variable
          remains in the graph pattern of <code>EXISTS</code> and the evaluation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
         <h4>Issue 3: Blank nodes substituted into BGPs act as variables</h4>
         <p>
           By making the current row, which can include blank nodes, available, and not
           modifying the BGP by substitution, no blank nodes are introduced into the
           evalaution of the BGP. Instead, the possible solutions is restricted by the
           current row.
         </p>
      </section>

      <section>
         <h4>Issue 4: Substitution can flip MINUS to its disjoint-domain case</h4>
         <p>
           Issue 4 is addressed because variablea re not removed from the domain of
           <code>MINUS</code>. This propsoal does not preserve all uses <code>MINUS</code>
           expressions; the problem identified in issue 4 is considered to be a bug in the original
           SPARQL specification.
         </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Issue 5: Substitution affects disconnected variables</h4>
        <p>
          Issue 5 is addressed by noting that variables inside sub-queries which are not
          projected can be renamed without affecting the sub-query results. Whether to
          preserve that invariant or allow the variables to be set by the current row is a
          choice point - this design preserves the independence of disconnected variables.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>The proposal described in this document does not no cover use of variables from
          the current row in a <tt>HAVING</tt> clause.

   <section> <h2>Proposal A</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>A Shallow-Binding Alternative to Substitution</h3>

      <p>
	This proposal for <code>EXISTS</code> emphasizes simplicity and
	the SPARQL notions of variable scoping and bottom-up evaluation of sub-queries over
	maximum compatability with the current SPARQL definition
	for <code>EXISTS</code>.
	Its basic idea is to inject values for the variables in-scope just
	outside a <code>FILTER</code> expression at the beginning of the
	pattern argument to <code>EXISTS</code> almost as if
	a <code>VALUES</code> construct was injected there.
	</p>

<ol>
<li> Modify the scoping rules so that variables in-scope at a
   <code>FILTER</code> are in-scope at the beginning of the pattern argument to
   any <code>EXISTS</code> in the <code>FILTER</code> expression.  (This is
   independent of the change to a mapping-based definition but fixes an
   error that affects <code>EXISTS</code>.)   The additional scoping rule could
   be written as:<br />
   In <code>FILTER ... EXISTS { P } ... </code> with <code>P</code> not a sub-select,
   if <code>v</code> is in-scope from the preceeding elements in the group graph
   pattern in which the <code>FILTER</code> is used then <code>v</code> is in-scope for an empty
   BGP that is considered to be inserted just before <code>P</code>.
   </li>
<li> Add a new construct, <code>Initial</code>, to the SPARQL syntax and
  algebra.  <code>Initial</code> will be used to set up the initial multiset of solution
  mappings inside an <code>EXISTS</code>.  It will work much like <code>VALUES</code> except
  that it will transfer solution mappings through the <code>EXISTS</code>
  instead of setting up a constant solution mapping.
  </li>
<li> When collecting <code>FILTER</code> elements replace
   <code>EXISTS P</code> in the filter expression with
   <code><em>exists(Initial(t),translate(</em>Initial(t) P'<em>))</em></code> 
   where <code>t</code> is a fresh token, and similarly for <code>NOT
   EXISTS {P}</code>.  If <code>P</code> is 
   a <tt>SubSelect</tt> then <code>P'</code> is <code>{P}</code>
   otherwise <code>P'</code> is just <code>P</code>.
   </li>
<li> Translate <code>Initial(t)</code> as itself. </li>
<li> Change the definition of the <code><em>exists</em></code> function to: <br/>
   Let <code><em>&mu;</em></code> be the current solution mapping for a filter, <code><em>t</em></code> a token,
   and <code><em>P</em></code> a graph pattern: The value <code><em>exists(Initial(t),P)</em></code>
   given <code><em>D(G)</em></code> is true iff
   <code><em>eval(D(G),<em>P'</em>)</em></code> is a non-empty multiset of solution
   bindings, where <code><em>P'</em> is <em>P</em></code> with 
   <code><em>Initial(t)</em></code> replaced by <code><em>{&mu;}</em></code>.
  </li>
</ol>

      <h3>Solutions</h3>
      <p>The same solution as for Proposal B can be used here to solve Issue 1.</p>
      <p>There is no substitution of variables by values (including blank
	nodes) thus solving Issues 2, 3, and 4.</p>
      <p>As the value-injection is done only at the beginning of the
      argument to <code>EXISTS</code> it will not affect disconnected
	variables, such solving Issue 5.</p>

        <h3>Translation of <tt>VALUES</tt></h3>

        <p>
          Near the end of section
          "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlTranslateGraphPatterns"
            >18.2.2.6 Translate Graph</a>" the translation of
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#data-block">inline data</a>
            should result in a <tt>ToMultiSet(data)</tt>.
          </p>
          <p>Translation of a trailing <tt>VALUES</tt> already uses this form.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              For each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rDataBlock">DataBlock</a>,
              form a solution mapping from the variable in the corresponding
              position in list of variables (or single variable),
              omitting a binding if the BindingValue is the word UNDEF.
            </p>
            <p>
              Combine each solution mappings into a solution sequence S, and apply <tt>ToMultiSet</tt>.
              <pre class="codeBlock">The result is ToMultiset(S)</pre>

        <p>The text in 18.2.4.3 then needs to be aligned:
